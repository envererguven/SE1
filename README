Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.
Ensure Ollama is running locally on port 11434 with the LLaMA 3.2:1b model pulled.
Build the images:
textdocker-compose build

Run the services:
textdocker-compose up -d

Access:

Frontend: http://localhost:8080 (admin panel).
Backend API: http://localhost:5000.
Elasticsearch: http://localhost:9200 (for debugging).


Stop:
textdocker-compose down


This setup is ready for testing. Extend by adding more endpoints or schema fields for other apps. If issues with Ollama embeddings, check model compatibility or adjust the get_embedding function. Let me know for refinements!2.5sHow can Grok help?
